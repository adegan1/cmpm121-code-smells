### ----- Code Smells -----

1. Mysterious Name

- Renamed most of the variables in the file so that their function is understandable at a glance. This makes it easier for the developer and future co-writers to be able to understand the code and add to it knowing exactly what everything should do.

2. Comments

- Removed many comments and made remaining ones more descriptive. There used to be a comment before almost every single line of code, which made the script much more difficult to read, often making the program seem more complicated than if they weren't there in the first place.

3. Data Clumps

- Put all similar data together in an interface so that it is more easily accessable and easier to read. Rather than having a long list of variables that all do very similar things, they are grouped together.
